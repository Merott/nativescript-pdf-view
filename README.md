# nativescript-pdf-viewer

This is a very basic PDF view implementation that does only one thing, and
that is to display PDF files. It conveniently uses the iOS `UIWebView`, but
for Android it uses [AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer).

This plugin does the bare minimum required to render the PDF, no configuration
options, and no error handling have been built yet. I welcome all Pull Requests!

# Usage

## Demo

Check out the [demo](./demo) folder for a sample usage.

## Angular 2

If you're using the plugin with Angular 2, the plugin automatically registers
`PDFViewer` as a valid tag for Angular templates. Usage is simple:

1. Make sure to import `nativescript-pdf-viewer` somewhere in your code, e.g:

  ```ts
  import 'nativescript-pdf-viewer';
  ```

2. Include the tag in your template:

  ```html
  <PDFViewer [src]="localPath"></PDFViewer>
  ```

# Try the Demo
